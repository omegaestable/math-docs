This is a collection of mathematical notes, projects, exercises & solutions, and research that I've accumulated throughout my teaching career and continued exploration of mathematics.

## What's Here

The exercises started as teaching materials but have evolved into something more personal. You'll find problem sets across various areas of mathematics, each with detailed solutions worked out step by step.

Beyond the exercises, this space will grow to include research articles and deeper explorations into mathematical ideas. These might be results I've worked through, interesting connections I've found between topics, or simply mathematical curiosities worth documenting.

## The Work

All documents are written in LaTeX, available both as source files and compiled PDFs. The problem sets typically include careful problem statements and complete solutions, with an emphasis on clarity and understanding rather than just reaching an answer.

Feel free to use these materials for learning or teaching purposes. If something here interests you or if you have questions, I'd be happy to hear about it.
