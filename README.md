# Mathematical Research & Teaching Archive

Welcome to my personal collection of mathematical documents, research, and teaching materials. This repository serves as a central archive for my academic work and explorations, ranging from undergraduate projects to master's thesis materials and miscellaneous notes accumulated throughout my teaching career.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 🎓 [LMFI](LMFI/) (Master's Material)
Resources and documents related to my Master's studies (Logique Mathématique et Fondements de l'Informatique).

*   **Memoire**: My Master's thesis material.
*   **Coursework**:
    *   **Calculabilité** (Computability Theory)
    *   **Ensembles** (Set Theory)
    *   **Modeles** (Model Theory)
*   **Exercises**: Problem sets and solutions (TDs).

### 🏛️ [Undergrad](Undergrad/) (College Projects)
A collection of projects and papers from my undergraduate years, covering various advanced mathematical topics:

*   **Logic & Model Theory**:
    *   *El espacio de n-tipos* (The Space of n-types)
    *   *Estructuras o-minimales* (O-minimal Structures)
*   **Algebra & Analysis**:
    *   *Cuerpos Ordenados* (Ordered Fields)
    *   *Integrales no elementales* (Non-elementary Integrals)
    *   *Números Trascendentes* (Transcendental Numbers)
    *   *Zeros de L-funciones* (Zeros of L-functions)

### 📚 [Books](Books/)
Longer-form content, teaching notes, and book drafts.

*   **Notas 1005 Padilla**: A comprehensive set of notes (including source LaTeX and generated figures).

## 🛠️ Usage

Most documents in this repository are written in **LaTeX**. To build the PDFs from source, you will need a standard TeX distribution (such as TeX Live, MacTeX, or MiKTeX).

Common build command for a file:

```bash
pdflatex filename.tex
# or using latexmk for automatic dependency handling
latexmk -pdf filename.tex
```
